## Gitcoin Passport score

Passport is an identity verification aggregator application. It allows users to grow personal ledgers of verifiable credentials about themselves and organizations to assess their identities to coordinate rights and responsibilities. Users collect “Stamps” from different authenticators around web2 and web3, such as Holonym (KYC), Civic (Biometrics), Google and LinkedIn (Web2), Guild and Snapshot (web3), and specific models that score a wallet based on web3 transaction history.

This recipe looks for a Gitcoin Passport score created as an attestation on Optimism. To learn more about Gitcoin Passport and to create the attestation, see https://passport.gitcoin.co.
