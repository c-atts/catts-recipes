# ENS name holder

Attest to the ownership of at least one ENS domain.

## ENS

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain, mapping human-readable names like ‘nick.eth’ to Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, and metadata. It supports reverse resolution, allowing Ethereum addresses to be associated with metadata such as primary names. ENS extends the capabilities of the traditional Domain Name System (DNS) by allowing DNS names to be imported into ENS through DNSSEC. Top-level domains like .eth are managed by smart contracts called registrars, enabling decentralized and trustless name registration on the Ethereum blockchain.
