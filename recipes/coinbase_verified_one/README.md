## About Coinbase verifications

Onchain verification leverages the Ethereum Attestation Service to enable the issuance of Coinbase-verified, onchain attestations. Initially, youâ€™ll verify that you have a valid Coinbase trading account and your country of residence (optional). These verifications can be tied to any self-custodial Ethereum (EVM) wallet address and are non-transferrable to other addresses.
