## About Retro Funding

Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) offers a sustainable model for individuals to receive rewards for their contributions to Optimism's success, ensuring that efforts are not only recognized but also effectively rewarded.

Retroactive Funding is based on the idea that it's easier to agree on what was useful in the past than what might be useful in the future. This is a series of experiments where members of the Citizens' House allocate rewards to projects they deem have provided positive impact to the Optimism Collective.

This is core to Optimism's value of impact = profit: the idea that that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded proportionally with profit to the individual.
